A sorcerer is fleeing to Canada to escape Delta Green. On the other side of the border, M-EPIC Officers are waiting to grab the wizard. Neither knows the other is there. The unfortunate sorcerer picks the Haskell Free Library and Opera House as a crossing point, a structure straddling the border between Stanstead, Quebec and Derby Line, Vermont.

THE HASKELL FREE LIBRARY AND OPERA HOUSE

From Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia

The library collection and opera stage are located in Stanstead, but the main entrance is located in Derby Line. Thus, the Haskell is sometimes called "the only library in the U.S.A. with no books" and "the only opera house in the U.S.A. with no stage". There is no entrance from Canada, however there is an emergency exit on the Canadian side. Patrons and visitors must use the US entrance. Patrons from Canada are permitted to enter the US door without reporting to customs, providing they return to Canada immediately upon leaving.

A thick black line runs beneath the seats of the opera house and diagonally across the center of the library's reading room to mark the border. The stage and half of the seats are in Canada, the remainder of the opera hall is in the US.

The library has a collection of more than 20,000 books in French and English, and is open 38 hours a week.

The building can be accessed through the main entrance on the US side, stairs up to the second floor on the US side, or an emergency exit on the Canadian side.

Opening the emergency exit will trigger an alarm, unless disabled with the appropriate Craft skill. Triggering the alarm prompts egress of the opera guests through both the emergency exit and the main entrance, inhibiting attempts to enter.

The Haskell building is watched by a US Border Patrol agent, to stop Canadians illegally entering the United States.

SETUP

It’s 9:00 PM. The parking lot outside is full. The opera is in progress.

The VECTOR(s) begins the scenario inside the Library and Opera House, where they have just fled to hide from pursuit by DG.

The DG Agent(s) begin on the American side of the Opera House. Their target has just fled inside.

The EPIC Officer(s) begin inside the opera house, lying in wait for their target, who will enter soon.

Delta Green gets a briefing based on which fugitive they are chasing:

    SERENA TESTER is an escaped convict, accompanied by some kind of accomplice
    DIGBY KORENCHKIN is a suspected burglar and arsonist, armed and dangerous
    RICHMOND CASTAIGNE is a patient from a state institution, a danger to himself and others

THE OPERA

The Opera is Quellcrist Thatcher’s award winning adaptation of Shadow of the Torturer, a post apocalyptic science-fantasy epic about a torturer exiled from his guild for the crime of showing mercy.

The programme:
8:00 - Prologue
8:31 - Act I
9:09 - 5 minute break
9:14 - Act II
10:00 - Intermission
10:20 - Act III
11:02 - 5 minute break
11:07 - Act IV
11:51 - Curtains
ADDING FRICTION

A wealthy socialite is attending the opera, rarely seen in the United States since its disastrous first showing at Chicago’s Titan Theater. The aristo’s armed bodyguard is wary of anyone acting suspicious near his meal ticket.

The play is being broadcast live on public access - both PBS and CBC. There are cameras and crew set up in the opera house, trained on the performance.

A medical emergency stops the performance. Everyone has their phones out to call 9/11. Anyone identifiable as law enforcement is pressed into performing CPR and rendering first aid until an AED is found.
DELTA GREEN AGENTS

DELTA GREEN Agents begin the game outside the Haskell Building on the United States side, tracking a vector who has just gone inside. They must stop the incursion and obscure Delta Green’s involvement. The sorcerer they’re tracking may have accomplices on the other side of the border.

NSA Colleagues 8
RITUALS: Elder Sign

    A mystical sigil. It commands respect from many of those from Outside. When gestured in the air (costing 2 WP and 1 SAN), it prevents such beings from coming within 10 meters of Clarke for 2D6 turns, provided he takes no hostile action against them. If an entity is somehow physically forced into that radius, it loses 1D6 POW per turn. As a gesture, the Elder Sign affects a given entity only once in 24 hours.

THE HAND AND THE HEART: Clarke carries a severed hand, preserved and covered in prayer tattoos blue with age. By clasping the hand and reciting these prayers, Clarke can enlist its aid to locate objects, sense danger, or navigate when lost. When “in-use”, or whenever it feels like, the hand crawls around on its fingers. It can attack people who threaten it, or its owner, by latching on to their throat with a 40% unarmed attack. It has a strong grip, considering its lack of leverage.

NSA analyst. Ability to sift through vast amounts of information, combined with position in the state’s intelligence apparatus and commitment to protecting United States from hidden threats, made him a natural fit for recruitment to Delta Green.

M-EPIC OFFICERS

The Environmental Policy Impact Commission is a front for Canadian anti-mythos operations. Officially its powers are investigating the environmental impact of policies, investigating environmental hazards, and producing recommendations to the government. Secretly, EPIC officers are vested with powers of arrest, search, seizure, and the use of force to protect the Confederation from the mythos.

EPIC Officers begin inside the Haskell Building. They may have made their presence known to management, or might be undercover among the audience. They’re here because they know a person of interest will enter the building soon. Their objective is to apprehend this person.

RITUALS: Fascination

    This ritual requires that operator speak calmly to the subject (not in a fight or beyond speaking distance) and takes a single turn, costing D6 SAN and 3 WP. If the Activation roll succeeds, the operator makes an opposed POW test vs the target. Success renders the subject motionless and insensate for up to an hour. Until then, only physical assault or some other overwhelming event shocks them out of it.

Finding

    A chant invokes the names of helper spirits It costs 4 WP and 1 SAN. For 3D6 minutes, it adds a +40% bonus to rolls to find something, if the lost thing is within 100 m.

Army intelligence in Afghanistan ‘01 to ‘08. Went civilian, recruited into CSIS. Aptitude for "unusual" case work brought her to EPIC's attention in ‘14. Transferred to Quebec office in ‘17. Officer in charge of field team.
VECTORS

VECTORS begin the game inside the Opera House. They know Delta Green is hunting them, and Canada won’t extradite anyone who faces the death penalty in their home country.

WHAT KIND OF VECTOR ARE YOU?
A Witch, escaped from prison with her familiar? (Serena)

BONDS: Melody Tester (Daughter) 5
“Pop-Tart” (Cellmate) 5
Sarah (Witch’s Familiar) 5
RITUALS: Infallible Suggestion

    This ritual requires strange gestures and a quiet chant. The operator must overcome the target in an opposed POW test. If that succeeds, the ritual costs 8 WP (or 1 POW) and 1D4 SAN. For one turn, the victim obeys any command given by the operator. Commanding a victim to murder, suicide, or some other awful act costs the operator the same SAN as the victim.

After being framed for financial crimes by her corrupt bosses, Serena Tester fell in with a bad crowd in Federal prison. A bad magical crowd, led by a witch who promised them freedom and power. When they broke out, “Web” immediately split from the coven and ran for the border. Accompanying her is the familiar the coven taught her to summon.

    At cost of 12 WP and D8 SAN, this chanted ritual withers flesh and blasts bones, inflicting 3 HP damage to the operator and 1D20 HP damage to a living target. The target must be nearby and in sight.

Digby Korenchkin broke into the old house expecting to find something valuable to steal. What he found inside was a voice from inside the walls, offering him fabulous power and riches in exchange for gruesome offerings. It was a profitable arrangement, for a while. When the house burned down with the wizard inside, Digby realized he’d been made, and made a run for the border.
RICHMOND CASTAIGNE - Heir to the Imperial Dynasty

BONDS: The Hanged King 3
The Drowned King 3
The Pallid King 3
THAT LITTLE YELLOW SIGN CAN’T BE IGNORED: Richmond carries within his mind the seal of the Imperial Dynasty. He can draw or inscribe it on any surface he pleases. Anyone who gazes at it is momentarily seized by its majesty, and by grand mal seizures. The convulsions last as long as they look at it.

Richmond Castaigne was in the hospital, recovering from a psychotic break, when he realized the truth: this is not the true world. The true world lies on the other side, and he is its sole son and heir. The small minded fools of this false realm have pursued him to the Canadian border, forcing him into temporary exile. Soon he will take his rightful place as the last scion of the Imperial Dynasty of Lost Ythil and Splendid Carcosa.
